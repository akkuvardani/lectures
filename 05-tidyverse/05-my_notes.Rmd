  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, G, AB:H) %>% 
  arrange(playerID, yearID, teamID) %>%

##semi_join() - return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.

players <- batting %>% 
   group_by(playerID)

players %>% 
  mutate(minrank = min_rank(desc(H)))

mutate(players, G_change = (G - lag(G)) / (yearID - lag(yearID)))

players %>% 
  mutate(improve = ifelse(G>lead(G),1,0)) 

##lead() and lag() have an optional argument order_by. If set, instead of using the row order to determine which value comes before another, they will use another variable. This is important if you have not already sorted the data, or you want to sort one way and lag another.

# For each player, find all where they played more games than average
filter(players, G > mean(G))
# For each, player compute a z score based on number of games played
mutate(players, G_z = (G - mean(G)) / sd(G))


players %>% 
  mutate(per=percent_rank(H)) %>% 
  mutate(cper=cume_dist(H)) 

##ntile() divides the data up into n evenly sized buckets. Itâ€™s a coarse ranking, and it can be used in with mutate() to divide the data into buckets for further summary. For example, we could use ntile() to divide the players within a team into four ranked groups, and calculate the average number of games within each group.

by_team_player <- group_by(batting, teamID, playerID)
by_team <- summarise(by_team_player, G = sum(G))
by_team_quartile <- group_by(by_team, quartile = ntile(G, 4))
